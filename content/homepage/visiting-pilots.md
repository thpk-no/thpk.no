Are you a visiting pilot who would like to fly withing Tromsø CTR?

Flying within Tromsø CTR is only possible **within specific areas
after obtaining permission** from the control tower.

We ask you to **fly with a local pilot** or at least **have a conversation
with a local pilot** to make sure we all use the airspaces correctly since
this is an arrangement between the authorities and the THPK club.

We ask you to not contact the Tromsø tower without contacting the club first.
