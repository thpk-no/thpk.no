### Tandem Paragliding from Fjellheisen

Would you like to join a flight and see Tromsø, Tromsdalen, and the Arctic
Cathedral from the air? THPK has tandem pilots with many years of experience
who are happy to take you on a tour. Each tour costs NOK 2000, which is paid
via VIPPS or cash in advance of the tour. If you do not wish to hike up, a
ticket for the cable car is also required.

For more information/booking, you can contact:
- Vegard Mellem: 41 21 21 26 (vmellem@gmail.com)
- Silvia Lutter: siwaa@web.de

The club also sells gift vouchers for tandem flights. Contact Vegard for more
information on that.

**Weather**: Paragliding is highly weather-dependent. It requires fair weather and
not too much wind. We cannot take off in easterly winds. In other words, it is
necessary to assess the possibilities 0-2 days before to see if a tour is
possible. We can accommodate short notice requests if you wish to fly on the
same day or the day after – if you book further in advance, we will need to
assess the weather forecast about two days before the tour.

**Duration**: A flight from Fjellheisen takes just under 10 minutes. If conditions
are good, it can last considerably longer. In rare cases, we have flown tandem
flights for up to an hour. From meeting at the launch site to landing, you
should expect 1-1.5 hours.

**Passenger requirements**: There is no age limit for passengers. We assume that
the passenger can run a few meters on terrain to launch the wing – and
therefore should wear sturdy shoes. We also need to know if the passenger is
taller/shorter or heavier than an average adult, as we need to bring suitable
equipment.

**Equipment and instruction**: We provide all necessary equipment. You only need to
dress for being outdoors for a couple of hours. All instruction takes place at
the launch site before the flight.

**Insurance**: All tandem flights in Norway are organized through clubs that are
members of the Norwegian Air Sports Federation. This means that all tandem
pilots have the correct certificates/licenses and all passengers are insured.

**Landing**: Normally, we land in a field near the Nova center in Tromsdalen (200m
north of Pyramiden). Some tours land on Mandelasletta – especially if the
passenger wants to fly over the roof of the Arctic Cathedral. Any spectators
should be at the landing site no later than 30 minutes after the passenger
meets at the launch site.

**Season**: The tandem season in Tromsø is from mid-April to the end of September.
Sometimes the weather allows flights a little before/after the season.

**Cancellation**: If the tour is not conducted, you do not pay. If the tour is
canceled at the launch site (due to weather/safety), you must pay for any cable
car ride down yourself.

**Tours from other locations**: We can fly tandem from most mountains. However,
this requires different logistics and planning. Feel free to contact us if you
have specific requests – we can discuss the possibilities. The
price/cancellation for such a tour will naturally be different.
